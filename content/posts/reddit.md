# Abstract

Youtube shorts, instagram reels, tiktokâ€“ these are all short videos. There is one niche in particular, where entertaining background footage is combined with text to speech storytelling that pulls quite a bit of traction and viewership.

Once you look at these videos a little more, you realize how simple they are. Thus, can they be automated?

## Yes, they can.

Here is a high level overview to how I started with nothing, and eventually built a discord bot and a frontend that **could do every part of the process**, from `finding a story` to `uploading` it to social media platforms.
