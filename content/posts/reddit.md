# Abstract

  Youtube shorts, Instagram reels, Tiktokâ€“ these are all short videos. There is one niche in particular, where entertaining background footage is combined with text to speech storytelling that pulls quite a bit of traction and viewership.

  Once you look at these videos a little more, you realize how simple they are. Thus, can they be automated?

## Yes, they can.

  Here is a high level overview of how I did it.

In the picture above, I create a reddit API instance and pull the top 400 comments from the post that I am interested in. The question is, how did I pick the comment I would use for my text to speech?

Early on, I was simply taking the **top comment** and just using that, but I noticed that the text to speech generated was pretty damn boring most of the time. For example, if the question:

`What is the most dangerous thing you have ever encountered?`

I would get videos where the story would be... pretty boring LOL. Recycling, Trash Cans, Mosquitos... I needed something that someone would stay and listen to. This led me to implement a way to rank each comment based on how interesting the comment is. How can we do this without human intervention? Large Language Models.

What I did was take each comment that fit the criteria I was looking for...

```python
if 500 < len(comment) < 700
	usable_comments.append(comment)
```

And use the `GroqCloud API` to score the comment on how interesting it would be to someone who has to listen to it play as text to speech.

I defined a function called `score()` which returns an integer score for the comment, and called that function on the `usable_comments` array. If you were curious, here is the pseudocode for the score function:

```python
# THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK IT IS JUST FOR THE IDEAS
# THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK IT IS JUST FOR THE IDEAS
# THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK IT IS JUST FOR THE IDEAS

def score(comment: str) -> int:
	
	client = groqclient.init()
	response = completion(
		{"system": "score this comment..."},
		{"content": comment}
	)

	score = response
	return score
```

To store the data, I created a dictionary that had the _comment_ as the key, and the **score** as the value.

```python
score_map = {}

for comment in usable_comments:
	result: int = score(comment)
	score_map.add(comment, result)
```

The comment I would use for my video would be the one with the highest score... obviously. However, I thought I would go a step further
